## About the Project

**Mate Engine** was created as a free alternative to **Desktop Mate**.

Why? Because **Desktop Mate** charges **$10–$25 USD** for single character models—prices comparable to full games on Steam. On top of that, modding and custom models were disabled in later versions.

**Mate Engine** solves both problems:

- It's **completely free**
- It supports **custom VRM avatars**
- It’s **open-source and moddable**

## Smoother Transitions

![Mate Engine Preview](https://i.imgur.com/qS894h9.gif)

Mate Engine offers smoother animation transitions than Desktop Mate, avoiding the glitchy, abrupt changes often found in commercial alternatives.

---

## Performance

![Mate Engine Preview](https://i.imgur.com/MTbnIeE.png)

**Mate Engine** is lightweight and efficient. RAM usage depends on the avatar’s texture size. For example, the high-quality "Alice" model uses ~190MB of texture memory, leading to ~200MB total RAM usage. Using lighter models will reduce this further.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: My VRM won’t load or inject!**  
A: This usually means your `.VRM` is incorrectly exported. Common issues include broken armatures or unsupported shaders. Use official exporters and test compatibility.

**Q: Is Hatsune Miku included?**  
A: No. Download her separately from [this Booth page](https://booth.pm/en/items/3226395).

**Need help with conversion?**  
Check this official guide: [VRM Conversion Guide](https://vrm.dev/en/vrm/how_to_make_vrm/)  
(Note: I can't provide support for model conversion.)
