# About the project

Mate Engine is a free alternative to the app **Desktop Mate**. This project exists because of the high price of Desktop Mate models, which range from **$10 to $25 USD**. Considering that full games are available at these prices on Steam and other platforms, paying **$20 to $25 USD** for a simple idle model feels unfair to many users.

Another reason for developing **Mate Engine** is that **Desktop Mate** removed mod support, making it difficult to add custom VRM models. 

Now, with **Mate Engine**, you get most of what Desktop Mate offers **for free**, including support for custom VRM models!

# Better Transitions!

**MateEngine** features smoother transitions between animations compared to *Desktop Mate*—see for yourself! *Desktop Mate* often feels clunky, with glitchy transitions between different states. In contrast, **MateEngine** delivers seamless and fluid transitions, no matter the state.


# Performance
![Mate Engine Preview](https://i.imgur.com/MTbnIeE.png)

**MateEngine** is more lightweight compared to Desktop Mate in terms of CPU and GPU usage. Depending on the model you use, RAM usage may increase or decrease.  
In the example model "Alice", we use a high-quality model with around **190MB** of texture memory, which is why the program consumes approximately **200MB** of RAM in the example image.  
Using models with lower texture memory will result in lower RAM usage. Overall, **MateEngine** is slightly more performant and lightweight.

## Future Updates (Pre-Release-2 up to 5)

- **Always on Top** – Toggle whether the Desktop Pet stays on top of all windows or moves behind them when you focus on a new window.  
- **Particle System** – Adds magical particle effects to your mouse or the pet itself for a more whimsical feel.  
- **Wallpaper Engine Integration** – Adds support for injecting the project into your Wallpaper Engine designs. You’ll be able to embed the entire Unity project directly into your wallpaper!  
- **Window & Taskbar Sitting** – Not 100% confirmed yet, as it’s a bit tricky to implement—but potentially allows your pet to sit directly on windows or the taskbar, just like in Desktop Mate.  
- **Menu Color Customization** – A fun little feature to let you personalize the menu colors—because who doesn’t love some flair?  
- **Initial Avatar Loading** – In the future, a "ModAvatar" folder will let you place your VRM files inside. The pet will automatically load your VRM on startup, no more re-injecting each time!

## Known Issues & Missing Features

- **Re-injecting Custom Models** – Each time you launch **Mate Engine**, you need to re-inject your own model.
- **No Window or Taskbar Sitting** – This feature is disabled due to the risk of getting banned in games like **CS2, CSGO, League of Legends, and others**. If a safe workaround is found, it will be implemented in the future.

## Virus Detection Warning :warning:

If **Windows Defender** detects a potential virus named `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B1ml`, **you can ignore it**. This is a **false positive** caused by the application not being digitally signed.

To verify that the application is safe, you can scan it using **VirusTotal** or other security services.
