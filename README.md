# About the project

Mate Engine is a free alternative to the app **Desktop Mate**. This project exists because of the high price of Desktop Mate models, which range from **$10 to $25 USD**. Considering that full games are available at these prices on Steam and other platforms, paying **$20 to $25 USD** for a simple idle model feels unfair to many users.

Another reason for developing **Mate Engine** is that **Desktop Mate** removed mod support, making it difficult to add custom VRM models. 

Now, with **Mate Engine**, you get most of what Desktop Mate offers **for free**, including support for custom VRM models!

Funds Raised: 239.34 USD / 100.00 USD
Date: 26th of March, 2025

Legendary List – These amazing people made it possible to publish this game on Steam for just $3.99 and helped cover the license cost needed to distribute my app there.

The app will cost $3.99 on Steam, but don’t worry — it will always be FREE here on GitHub!
If you’d like to support future updates, feel free to grab it on Steam.
And if money’s tight for any reason, no stress — you can always download the app for free from this GitHub page, and yes, it will always stay up-to-date!

Supporters:
- Gra**** Ja***** – $94.00
- Co**** Da***** – $96.00
- Dym**** Sk***** – $5.59
- Dreezer - $45.00

In order to publish this app on Steam once it's stable, I need to pay a one-time fee of $100 USD. Since this project is completely free, I would truly appreciate any donations!

I'm only collecting enough to cover the one-time fee—I don’t plan to accept anything beyond that.
If you’d like to support the project, please send any amount you can spare to my PayPal: johnson@soultechno.de

Be sure to include a note saying "MateEngine Donation" so I can keep things organized on my end. Thank you so much for your support!

# Better Transitions!

**MateEngine** features smoother transitions between animations compared to *Desktop Mate*—see for yourself! *Desktop Mate* often feels clunky, with glitchy transitions between different states. In contrast, **MateEngine** delivers seamless and fluid transitions, no matter the state.


# Performance
![Mate Engine Preview](https://i.imgur.com/MTbnIeE.png)

**MateEngine** is more lightweight compared to Desktop Mate in terms of CPU and GPU usage. Depending on the model you use, RAM usage may increase or decrease.  
In the example model "Alice", we use a high-quality model with around **190MB** of texture memory, which is why the program consumes approximately **200MB** of RAM in the example image.  
Using models with lower texture memory will result in lower RAM usage. Overall, **MateEngine** is slightly more performant and lightweight.

## Features

- **Idle Animations** – The avatar will play looping idle animations while staying on your desktop.
- **Drag Animation** – The avatar will float when you move it around.
- **Dance Animation (Experimental)** – The avatar will dance when you play music on **Spotify, Mozilla Firefox**, and other apps.
- **Inject Mode** – You can inject your own custom model as long as it's a **.VRM** model that is correctly rigged and has valid bone names.
- **Options Menu** – Click on the avatar and press `M` to open the **Mate Engine** options menu.

---
## Future Updates (Pre-Release-5 up to 10)

- **Wallpaper Engine Integration** – Adds support for injecting the project into your Wallpaper Engine designs. You’ll be able to embed the entire Unity project directly into your wallpaper!  
- **Window & Taskbar Sitting** – Not 100% confirmed yet, as it’s a bit tricky to implement—but potentially allows your pet to sit directly on windows or the taskbar, just like in Desktop Mate.  
- **Menu Color Customization** – A fun little feature to let you personalize the menu colors—because who doesn’t love some flair?  

---
## Known Issues & Missing Features

- **Re-injecting Custom Models** – Each time you launch **Mate Engine**, you need to re-inject your own model.
- **No Window or Taskbar Sitting** – This feature is disabled due to the risk of getting banned in games like **CS2, CSGO, League of Legends, and others**. If a safe workaround is found, it will be implemented in the future.

## Frequeintly Asked
**Q: The VRM doesn't inject, or my model doesn't work with your app!**

**A:** This issue is not caused by the app itself but by your `.VRM` model file being invalid or improperly formatted. If you created the `.VRM` file yourself or received it from someone who converted an `.fbx`, `.obj`, or `.mmd` file to `.VRM`, please ensure the conversion was done correctly.

For guidance on properly converting files into the `.VRM` format, you can follow tutorials available here:

- [VRM Conversion Guide](https://vrm.dev/en/vrm/how_to_make_vrm/)

Please note, assistance with converting models into `.VRM` files is outside the scope of support provided here.

## Virus Detection Warning :warning:

If **Windows Defender** detects a potential virus named `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B1ml`, **you can ignore it**. This is a **false positive** caused by the application not being digitally signed.
