# Mate-Engine
A free Desktop Mate alternative with a lightweight interface and custom VRM support, though with fewer features.


# Mate Engine

Mate Engine is a free alternative to the app **Desktop Mate**. This project exists because of the high price of Desktop Mate models, which range from **$10 to $25 USD**. Considering that full games are available at these prices on Steam and other platforms, paying **$20 to $25 USD** for a simple idle model feels unfair to many users.

Another reason for developing **Mate Engine** is that **Desktop Mate** removed mod support, making it difficult to add custom VRM models. 

Now, with **Mate Engine**, you get most of what Desktop Mate offers **for free**, including support for custom VRM models!

## I Need Your Help! üõ†Ô∏è

If you have experience with **C#** or **Unity animations**, I would appreciate any help!

- I am not a **C# expert**, so any **pull requests** or contributions are welcome.
- If you're skilled in **Unity animations**, I need help creating **dragging, dancing, and idle animations**. I prefer to keep **Mate Engine** free, so I won‚Äôt be hiring paid artists‚Äîthis is a community-driven project!

If you‚Äôre interested in helping, feel free to contribute! üöÄ

## Virus Detection Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

If **Windows Defender** detects a potential virus named `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B1ml`, **you can ignore it**. This is a **false positive** caused by the application not being digitally signed.

To verify that the application is safe, you can scan it using **VirusTotal** or other security services.
